The BRAIN Genius program is a leveled system for WorldQuant BRAIN consultants that provides increasing access to data, tools, and opportunities based on performance and activity levels. There are four levels: Gold (default level for new BRAIN consultants), Expert, Master, and Grand Master. These levels are an extension to the user-level levels that you are already familiar with: Bronze, Silver and Gold.

 What are the main benefits of advancing to higher levels?

Higher levels provide:

    Access to more operators, research regions, datasets and data fields for each level
    Ability to create SuperAlphas from a wider pool
    Less frequent requirement for biometrics sign-in
    Certificates and badges
    WorldQuant consistently searches for top talent to consider for eligible internship and full-time employment opportunities. In particular, those consultants who reach Master and Grand Master level are more likely to be considered for such internship  and full-time employment opportunities
    In addition, due to the access to more data, operators and other features, consultants at higher levels have a better opportunity to potentially receive higher quarterly payments amounts.  Consultants who reach the Grand Master level can see increases to their Quarterly Payment amounts of 80x or more, potentially earning upwards of $8,000 or more in a Quarterly Payment amount.

 How often are these levels evaluated?

WorldQuant may evaluate levels on a quarterly basis. Once you qualify for a level, you retain that level for at least 6 months (the current quarter plus a 3-month grace period).  Changes in a consultant’s levels will take effect within the first week of each calendar quarter after each re-evaluation, starting 1st Jan 2025.

You can view your current level and progress towards the next level on the Genius dashboard. This displays metrics, such as (i) your current signal count, (ii) number of pyramids you have formulated, and (iii) combined performance of your Alphas relative to the thresholds for the next level.

 What happens if I don't meet the criteria for my current level in a given quarter?

You have a 3-month grace period where you retain the current level for which you qualified in the last quarter. If you don't meet the then-current criteria at the time of a re-evaluation to remain in that level (or move into the next higher level) after the grace period, you may be moved to a lower level.

 Can I lose access to features if I move into a lower level?

Yes, if you move to a lower level, you may lose access to certain datasets, operators, and other features associated with higher levels.  Note that moving to a lower level may prevent you from re-simulating previously created alphas if they use data fields or operators you no longer have access to.


 How can I regain a higher level after moving into a lower level?

You'll need to meet the then-current criteria for the higher level in a subsequent quarter. Focus on increasing your signal submissions, formulating more pyramids, and improving your “Combined Alpha Performance”.

Moving to a lower level may prevent you from re-simulating previously created alphas if they use data fields or operators you no longer have access to.
